# ðŸ“š Awesome Book Summaries

A curation of book summary sites in the spirit of an [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md).

You can search the collection of summary sites for a book using this search query link (replace "BOOK_TITLE" with your book):

<!-- query-section:start -->
[Google Search query](https://www.google.com/search?q=BOOK_TITLE%20site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsive.rs%2Fbook%20OR%20site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Ftechratchet.com%2F%20OR%20site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nateliason.com%2Fnotes%20OR%20site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.samuelthomasdavies.com%2Fbook-summaries%2F)

or, manually:

```
BOOK_TITLE site:https://sive.rs/book OR site:https://techratchet.com/ OR site:https://www.nateliason.com/notes OR site:https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/
```
<!-- query-section:end -->

# Contribution Guidelines

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Summary sites should be high-quality, providing exceptional value above what someone could find with a general Google search for "BOOK_TITLE summary".
* Summary sites should be publicly accessible without any form of signup.
* Summaries should be multiple paragraphs, providing more than just a surface-level overview of the book.

*Examples of inappropriate sites: `blinkist.com`, `shortform.com`, `fourminutebooks.com`, `sparknotes.com`, `booksummary.net`.*

**Formatting Guidance:**

* Entries in the "Summary Sites" list should link to a page which lists all summaries on that site. This link will be used to autogenerate a Google Search query that searches over all the summary sites.
* Titles should either be the original site title, or an editorialized version in the format "Author: Page title". Do not include book counts in the title, since they drift out of date.
